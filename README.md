# Reddit-Carbon-Theme
I've taken the theme that requires reddit gold and modified it a bit to make it work properly (mostly with RES).

**A few notes:**
* Make sure you go to your [reddit preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) and disable custom css (under display options)
* You can use an extension such as [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) to install it. Once you have the extension, copy all of the css from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmcgurty/Reddit-Carbon-Theme/master/theme.css), paste it into [here](chrome-extension://fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe/edit.html),  give it a name, and make sure it applies to "URLs starting with: https://www.reddit.com/"
